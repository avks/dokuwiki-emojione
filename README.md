### 😄 Emojione for Dokuwiki
A very simple plugin that lets you insert native emojis using [EmojioneArea](https://github.com/mervick/emojionearea)

Emoji-picker is available on the wikitext editor in two ways:

1. Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd>
2. Typing `:`

I wrote this plugin in 30 minutes to learn how to write a simple Dokuwiki plugin. This is my first plugin, many best practices may not have been followed. So please be gentle on me. 😟

I have made some initial tests only. Use it at your own risk! 😨
